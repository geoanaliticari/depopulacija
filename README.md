# About
The project “Remote detection of (de)population processes” was realized as one of the winning solutions to the challenge “Data to better understand the depopulation process”. The basic idea is to identify changes and trends in population, i.e. monitoring the depopulation process at different levels of the territorial organization of the Republic of Serbia using data sets based on satellite remote sensing. The project aims to create a permanent infrastructure of different data sets that will serve as a unique system for monitoring the depopulation process in Serbia.

It has been produced with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) support, within the Depopulation Data Challenge Call.
