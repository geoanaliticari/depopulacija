# About
The project “Remote detection of (de)population processes” was realized as one of the winning solutions to the challenge “Data to better understand the depopulation process” published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in Serbia. The basic idea of the project is to identify changes and trends in population, i.e. monitoring the depopulation process at different levels of the territorial organization of the Republic of Serbia using data sets based on satellite remote sensing. The project aims to create a permanent infrastructure of different data sets that will serve as a unique system for monitoring the depopulation process in Serbia.
